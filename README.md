Analysis of my <a href="https://tidal.com/">Tidal</a> music streaming history from 2018 - 2025. The data from years 2018 and 2025 are partial, and so are only used for cumulative totals, and excluded in yearly or average calculations.

DATA

The data was requested and downloaded from Tidal on February 19, 2025, and is made public by my choice.

DATA CLEANING

Data was clean. But manipulation and exploration was done by SQL and in Tableau.

ANALYSIS

A general analysis and visualization can be found in the <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/adamalvarado/viz/TidalStreamingHistory/Dashboard">Tableau</a> dashboard.
